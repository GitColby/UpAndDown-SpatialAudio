# 🎧 UpAndDown–SpatialAudio

A 360° spatial audio and video research project combining ambisonic recording, binaural mixing in Reaper, and immersive production techniques. The project is built around the original track **_Up and Down_**, written and performed by **Colby Weiser** (guitar) and **William Andrea** (vocals).

## 🔍 Overview

This project explores spatial audio workflows designed for immersive environments like VR and 360° video. It incorporates ambisonic audio captured with a **Sennheiser AMBEO VR mic**, 360° footage captured with a **Ricoh Theta**, and spatial mixing using **Reaper** with custom VSTs and plugins.

### 🎬 Final Deliverables:
- A spatial 360° YouTube video (YouTube-ready render)
- Mastered binaural and stereo mixes
- A research prototype demonstrating ambisonic-to-binaural rendering techniques
- Documentation on setup, workflow, and findings
